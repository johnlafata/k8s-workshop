# CI/CD Deployment Strategies for Kubernetes

## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Description**: Maintain two identical production environments (blue and green)
- **Process**: Deploy to inactive environment, then switch traffic
- **Benefits**: Zero downtime, instant rollback
- **Drawbacks**: Requires double infrastructure

### Rolling Updates
- **Description**: Gradually replace old pods with new ones
- **Process**: Update pods incrementally while maintaining service availability
- **Benefits**: No downtime, resource efficient
- **Drawbacks**: Slower deployment, potential version mixing

### Canary Deployment
- **Description**: Deploy to small subset of users first
- **Process**: Gradually increase traffic to new version
- **Benefits**: Risk mitigation, real-world testing
- **Drawbacks**: Complex traffic management

### Recreate Strategy
- **Description**: Stop all old pods, then start new ones
- **Process**: Complete shutdown and restart
- **Benefits**: Simple, clean state
- **Drawbacks**: Downtime required
